# EMToolKit
Repository for EMToolKit project for computing Solar Differential Emission Measures in Python

To run the example notebook, you'll need python set up with Sunpy, Numpy, Astropy, and the latest version of NDCube (see https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/ndcube/en/latest/installation.html). After that, example should work with the existing directory structure. Let me know if not, of course!
